        One day a hunter sets a net to catch birds and placed grains and rice over the net.<br>
		After some time a flock of pigeons comes by and start eating grains and get caught in the net.<br>
		After some time they started losing hope, then their leader asks them to fly together up in the sky.<br> 
		They did as they were told and carried the net away. The hunter runs after them but they flew away<br> 
		to their friendâ€™s mouse hole. Then the mouse cuts the net and freed the pigeons.<br>
