    <p>
        Once there was a Lion in the jungle who used to kill 2-3 animals daily for his meal.<br>
		All animals went to him to tell, that daily one of them will come to him for his meal.<br>
		So, the Lion agreed and this started going for many days. One day, it was Rabbitâ€™s turn.<br>
		When he was on his way he saw a well. Now he plans to kill the lion and save himself.<br>
		He went to the lion and told him that, there is another lion who claims to be more powerful than him.<br>
		Then the lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion. The rabbit takes him to the well and said he lives here.<br>
		When the lion looked in the well he saw his own reflection and jumped in the well and dies.<br>
